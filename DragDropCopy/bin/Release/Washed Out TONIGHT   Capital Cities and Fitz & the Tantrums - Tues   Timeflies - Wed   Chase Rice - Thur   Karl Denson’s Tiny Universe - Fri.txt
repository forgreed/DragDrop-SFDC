WASHED OUT
Ponderosa
Monday, November 4th
 
We have an EXTREMELY packed month of shows for you – only a few nights
will pass in November 2013 when we don’t have an awesome act gracing our
stage. It’s gonna be a blast!

We’ll dive in with the show coming up tonight, Monday November 4th:
Washed Out. Washed Out delivers a pristine, ethereal live show that sets
a new standard for how chillwave – his brand of mellow, atmospheric
electronic music - should sound and look. Washed Out is Ernest Greene
and his talented four-piece backing band playing live instruments along
with his digital production and vocals. Rather than come out and remain
fixed behind a laptop or keyboards all night, Greene is a personable,
jubilant frontman, playing the role of a chillwave cheerleader who helps
to get his audiences to lose their inhibitions and dance to the towering
beats the band generates.
 
Listen to Washed Out here (this is his song, Feel it All Around, which
many of you will recognize as the theme song for the series
“Portlandia”): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggr3VcbAcME

d87c10a64&id=f1d7783c97&e=61c898a7c1> 

This artist is growing every time he comes back to Asheville – don’t
miss the show before it sells out!

FITZ & THE TANTRUMS and CAPITAL CITIES
Beat Club
Tuesday, November 5th
 
Tuesday night, a show we’ve been waiting for a long time – the co-bill
between Fitz and the Tantrums and Capital Cities! Fitz and the Tantrums
have visited us a few times before, and always bring an awesome dance
party with their throw-back, motown inspired neo soul/indie pop. LA pop
duo, Capital Cities, has had the hit single of the summer and fall with
their track, “Safe and Sound.” (Recognize it? Listen here

plus views on Youtube – wow!) We know Fitz puts on what critics have
called, “a captivatingly crazy live show,” so we can’t wait to see both
of these bands together on one night!

FITZ & THE TANTRUMS and CAPITAL CITIES
Beat Club
Tuesday, November 5th
 
Tuesday night, a show we’ve been waiting for a long time – the co-bill
between Fitz and the Tantrums and Capital Cities! Fitz and the Tantrums
have visited us a few times before, and always bring an awesome dance
party with their throw-back, motown inspired neo soul/indie pop. LA pop
duo, Capital Cities, has had the hit single of the summer and fall with
their track, “Safe and Sound.” (Recognize it? Listen here

d87c10a64&id=374953530e&e=61c898a7c1> . It only has a mere 37 million
plus views on Youtube – wow!) We know Fitz puts on what critics have
called, “a captivatingly crazy live show,” so we can’t wait to see both
of these bands together on one night!
