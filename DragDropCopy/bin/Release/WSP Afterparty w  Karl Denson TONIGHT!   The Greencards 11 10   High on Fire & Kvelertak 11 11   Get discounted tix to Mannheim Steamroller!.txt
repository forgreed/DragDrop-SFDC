THE GREENCARDS
Sons Of Fathers
Sunday, November 10th
 
Sunday night, join us for a night of bluegrass by Grammy-nominated,
Austin-based bluegrass group, The Greencards. The name came from the
fact that the band members originally made there way to the US to from
Australia and New Zealand. The band has toured extensively with Bob
Dylan and Willie Nelson, and released six albums including one this past
summer.
 
A quirky, adventurous, utterly compelling reinvention of American roots
music, steeped in bluegrass, seasoned with folk, rock, and a dash of
Latin influences; Blurt.com calls their music “an adroit example of what
exceptional skill and unerring taste can reap when deftly applied.” Time
Magazine praises their “laid back tunes that land in a sweet spot
halfway between Americana and bluegrass.”
 
Tickets are still available and will only cost you $12 if you get them
before Sunday!

HIGH ON FIRE & KVELERTAK
Doomriders
Monday, November 11th

Monday night, November 11th, we’ve got Norwegian thrash-metal sextet
Kvelertak co-headlining with High on Fire. Kvelertak are one of 2013’s
buzziest hard rock bands currently touring their much-lauded release of
the Kurt Ballou (Converge) produced album Meir. High on Fire is
universally recognized as one of the most potent acts in music today,
creating modern heavy metal that merges primal fury and aggression,
hesher bombast and hall of fame heaviness. Described as “a supersonic
exercise in conquest by volume,” High On Fire has rewritten the hard
rock rule book since its formation in 1998, forging a style and sound
that is both critically celebrated and absolutely unique. The group
features vocalist and cult guitar hero Matt Pike — also a founding
member of the famed underground band Sleep — along with powerhouse
drummer Des Kensel and talented bassist Jeff Matz. Pike was named as one
of Rolling Stone’s “New Guitar Gods”.  Tickets are on sale now for $15
and this one is All Ages.

d87c10a64&id=c7008bc1f4&e=61c898a7c1>  for tickets), we also present
British singer-songwriter Laura Marling down the street at Diana Wortham
Theater! Marling is no normal 23-year-old. Three albums, two Mercury
nominations and a Brit Award into her career, she performs backed by a
seven-piece band, which included in its ranks a banjo player and
violinist (though none of the Mumfords & Sons members, who used to
support her). Yet Marling also dazzles with just her beautiful voice and
an acoustic guitar.

THE GREENCARDS
Sons Of Fathers
Sunday, November 10th
 
Sunday night, join us for a night of bluegrass by Grammy-nominated,
Austin-based bluegrass group, The Greencards. The name came from the
fact that the band members originally made there way to the US to from
Australia and New Zealand. The band has toured extensively with Bob
Dylan and Willie Nelson, and released six albums including one this past
summer.
 
A quirky, adventurous, utterly compelling reinvention of American roots
music, steeped in bluegrass, seasoned with folk, rock, and a dash of
Latin influences; Blurt.com calls their music “an adroit example of what
exceptional skill and unerring taste can reap when deftly applied.” Time
Magazine praises their “laid back tunes that land in a sweet spot
halfway between Americana and bluegrass.”
 
Tickets are still available and will only cost you $12 if you get them
before Sunday!

HIGH ON FIRE & KVELERTAK
Doomriders
Monday, November 11th

Monday night, November 11th, we’ve got Norwegian thrash-metal sextet
Kvelertak co-headlining with High on Fire. Kvelertak are one of 2013’s
buzziest hard rock bands currently touring their much-lauded release of
the Kurt Ballou (Converge) produced album Meir. High on Fire is
universally recognized as one of the most potent acts in music today,
creating modern heavy metal that merges primal fury and aggression,
hesher bombast and hall of fame heaviness. Described as “a supersonic
exercise in conquest by volume,” High On Fire has rewritten the hard
rock rule book since its formation in 1998, forging a style and sound
that is both critically celebrated and absolutely unique. The group
features vocalist and cult guitar hero Matt Pike — also a founding
member of the famed underground band Sleep — along with powerhouse
drummer Des Kensel and talented bassist Jeff Matz. Pike was named as one
of Rolling Stone’s “New Guitar Gods”.  Tickets are on sale now for $15
and this one is All Ages.

d87c10a64&id=c7008bc1f4&e=61c898a7c1>  for tickets), we also present
British singer-songwriter Laura Marling down the street at Diana Wortham
Theater! Marling is no normal 23-year-old. Three albums, two Mercury
nominations and a Brit Award into her career, she performs backed by a
seven-piece band, which included in its ranks a banjo player and
violinist (though none of the Mumfords & Sons members, who used to
support her). Yet Marling also dazzles with just her beautiful voice and
an acoustic guitar.
