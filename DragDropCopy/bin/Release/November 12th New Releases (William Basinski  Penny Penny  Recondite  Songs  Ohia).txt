For a collection of music built around the poignant inevitability of
decay, there has been a great many hopeful and inspired words devoted to
William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops: stunning, ethereal,
majestic, transfixing, life-affirming… and for good reason. From its
20-year gestation period to its infamously fateful completion, The
Disintegration Loops is one of the most powerful manifestations of the
inevitable cycle of life ever committed to tape, even as it documents
the inevitable decay of all that is committed to tape. The very passage
of time is its most effective instrument. To mark the 10-year
anniversary of its original release – and its forthcoming induction into
the 9/11 Memorial Museum this year – Temporary Residence Ltd. is honored
to collaborate with William Basinski in presenting The Disintegration
Loops in a fashion truly befitting a library of music with such a
lasting legacy. This breathtaking limited-edition, numbered box set
contains all four historic volumes, plus a pair of stunning live
orchestral performances from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the
54th Venice Biennale, both previously unreleased. Remastered from the
original recordings, this exquisite box set also includes the extremely
rare 63-minute The Disintegration Loops film on DVD, and a 148-page
fullcolor book featuring rare photos taken during the making of The
Disintegration Loops, and liner notes by Basinski, Antony, David Tibet
of Current 93, Ronen Givony of the Wordless Music Series, and Michael
Shulan, Creative Director of the National September 11 Memorial Museum.

PENNY PENNY

Title: Shaka Bundu
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: CD/2xLP
Catalog number: ATFA008cd/lp 
Label: Awesome Tapes From Africa

"Shichangani" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mqubaoauuqmuacaweafamjjsw/click.php>
The story of South African singer and dancer Penny Penny is fit for
Hollywood. A nearly homeless janitor with no education gets a record
deal, becomes a multi-platinum-selling pop star, plays stadiums across
Africa, then builds a career as a politician for Mandela's African
National Congress party. Penny Penny's debut recording Shaka Bundu,
recorded in 1994, is the album that took a 34-year-old Giyani Kulani
Kobane from the streets of Johannesburg to the chambers of power. After
a chance meeting with Tsonga disco producer Joe Shirimani, just six
months after apartheid was lifted, Penny Penny's Shaka Bundu was
released and entered the consciousness of the entire country. Penny
Penny became an immediate sensation, against the expectations of
everyone involved. The album went on to sell more than 250,000 copies in
South Africa and Penny Penny has played to thousands on stadium stages
from Liberia and Sierra Leone to Namibia and Mozambique. The music was
something new for Tsonga disco. Slow house music rhythms became the
foundation for Penny's anthemic exultations. Using Atari computers, Korg
M1 synthesizer and reel-to-reel tape for vocals, Penny and Shirimani cut
the entire record in just seven days. Their signature bass sound
combined richness and sharpness with the root tones of an organ. Penny's
rap-like delivery became his calling card: a husky, playful vocal
performance heavy on vibes. Nearly 20 years since Shaka Bundu blasted
from speakers across a newly free South Africa, the music still sounds
big and worldly. And, despite shifting his energies from stadium shows
to municipal matters, Penny Penny still sports his signature top-bun
hairstyle.

RECONDITE

Title: Hinterland
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: CD/2xLP
Catalog number: GI190cd/lp 
Label: Ghostly International

"Abscondence" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mquwatauuqmuaiawearamjjsw/click.php>
Hinterland is another step forward in Berlin-based producer Recondite's
progression, maintaining a style all his own and acknowledging the
finest moments in his previous releases. It's no small feat to
incorporate one's observations of human nature against nature, and to
lay it out in such a way that is cohesive, linear and sonically
beautiful both up close and from a distance. "Characteristics of
people's minds," he says. "Such as satisfied, frightened, calm,
melancholic, sad, stoic, frustrated, strong, deep…they are captured in
the sounds."

Recondite's production career has only spanned a handful of years, but
his versatility with electronic music as an expressive medium puts him
beyond others with discographies twice as long. Lush, gorgeous, and
vibrant are three words that can often describe his original
productions, whether it's floating in a beatless ambience or driving a
hard rhythm through the soundsystem of a nightclub or warehouse.

"Boro" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mquyalauuqmuapaweaoamjjsw/click.php> 


Sinuous ecometric rhythms and dense rain-blown tone sculptures shine and
wind between electrified cotton-nodes, all careening, sliding, colliding
across and through a synaptic panorama. Peninsula-based KILN are Kevin
Hayes on pulse, tump, tick with Kirk Marrison and Clark Rehberg III on
hue, shape and spark. After a decade of genre spinning and attention
spent fusing live organikas with binary tumbleweeds, KILN settles into a
new neurologic with their upcoming release this spring on Ghostly. Not
only for the headphone set, KILN’s recent intent has been on finding the
intuitive fulcrum of gentle momentum invigoration and hyperacoustic
digi-texture chromatics as suited for a wider listening environment.
Kiln’s latest humanist gallery will appeal to any and all who lust for
fine sound form.

SONGS: OHIA

Title: Magnolia Electric Co. (Deluxe Reissue)
Release date: 11/12/13

"Farewell Transmission (Demo)"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqeuadauuqmuataweafamjjsw/click.php> 
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqeeatauuqmuanaweazamjjsw/click.php> 
 
The hallmark of Jason Molina's career, Magnolia Electric Co., is both a
confluence of all he would create and a line in the sand to mark a shift
in his songwriting approach. It was the last statement under his iconic
Songs: Ohia moniker, and the moment before he began making new legends
as Magnolia Electric Co. for the next 10 years. Now— here at the end of
that decade — with Molina gone, his work gathers more weight and
meaning. This expanded 10-year anniversary edition of Magnolia Electric
Co. features one never-before-released track plus many rarities. The
full-band studio outtake of fan favorite "Whip Poor Will" is a sweet and
spare version that ended up being played far differently on Magnolia
Electric Co.'s final album Josephine (2009). Also included is the studio
version of "The Big Game Is Every Night." Previously only available on
the Japanese version of the album, this opus serves as Molina's thesis
statement, its poetry weaving through the 20th Century, through art and
sporting culture — ultimately questioning what it means to be an
American in the autumn of the American Era. The edition also gathers
Molina's gutting demos for the record, including those two outtakes.
Nearly each begins with audible sound of the RECORD button being pressed
down on the tape player. They are so close and intimate, it's hard to
look them right in the eyes. But you should.

THE HUNT

Title: The Hunt Begins
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: CD/LP
Catalog number: SBR100cd/lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $12.99/$16.99
 
2007.  The cover art for 1st record Sacred Bones released depicted an
androgynous wild banshee wearing warpaint, clad all in leather and
animal bones, holding a sacrificial knife pointed at the sky. Our debut
single was The Hunt's lone statement.  The songs were a visceral
pulsation, etched in echo. London, structure fires and mental
institutions all played a part in the downfall of the originators of
21st century redskin darkwave.

2009. After multiple tumultuous attempts at recording a full length The
Hunt decamped to their collective hometown, Boston, to record the
ultimate document of their time on earth. This document sat for years,
untouched by human hands.

2013. The Hunt lives on. In honor of both the first and one hundredth
release, we will finally see and hear the toils of New York's most
enigmatic post punk band of recent. Ian Danger, percussive wunderkind,
Mike O'Brien, whose four strings drew blood nightly, Christian Kount,
master of negative space and Jasper McGandy, the man who's hopes for a
darker future led them towards a reality we only now have the honor of
witnessing. After all these years the time has come. The Hunt Begins.

"Grass Above My Head"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqebadauuqmuaxaweaxamjjsw/click.php> 

Cian Nugent is a guitar player from Dublin, Ireland whose music combines
personal passions, such as suburban/coastal blues, traditional music,
1960s & ’70s singer-songwriters, psychedelic rock,critically jazz
ambitions and 20th century composition. Born With The Caul is his first
full length with 4 piece-band The Cosmos and follows his acclaimed 2011
solo effort Doubles. Like that album, Caul is comprised of a few
expansive, developed pieces (three, to be exact). Led by Nugent’s guitar
playing – always inviting, subdued and unpredictable – the band takes
these songs into darker, richer territories opening a whole new galaxy
for this young guitar player to explore.

YEASAYER

Title: Good Evening Washington D.C., Live at 9:30 Club
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 2xLP 

Catalog number: SC302lp 
Label: Secretly Canadian
Price: $19.99

 
 


Yeasayer has seen the road more than the average band.  In just three
albums they have played well over 600 shows in 5 continents.  They've
played to 5, they've played to 35,000. Shows have been great, good, bad,
and a few just terrible.  Gear has been left on tarmacs, computers lost
in taxis, fights, firings, bonds broken and made, and fans gained show
by show.  It's an arduous process being a modern band, but throughout it
all Yeasayer has become one of the best touring acts out there.

Good Evening Washington DC, Live at 9:30 Club was recorded on the
Fragrant World Tour during a sold out two-night stand on November 14th +
15th, 2012.  A fitting location seeing as members of the band used to go
to shows at the 9:30 Club when they were teenagers.  Much like the
band’s first live album, Live at Ancienne Belqique, this recording was
created specifically with Yeasayer fans in mind.  

With that said, over the years it's become evident that the live show,
for many, is the gateway to understanding the band, their music, and
their varied albums.  Sonically shifting record to record, Yeasayer are
able to incorporate songs from all three albums into an incredibly
cohesive live show.  The songs aren't played verbatim.  Rather, even for
the avid Yeasayer fan, they are transformed in to something fresh and
different.

Though this is the first time the band is putting a live event into
physical form, the hope is there will be more opportunities down the
road as live recording gets more affordable.

DAVID LYNCH

Title: Bad The John Boy
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 12”
Catalog number: SBR110lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $10.99


On the heels of David Lynch’s hugely successful sophomore full length,
The Big Dream, comes a very limited edition 12”, Bad The John Boy. While
technically this track qualifies as a non-album or bonus track, this
song was made around the same time as the track, We Rolled Together.
Producer Dean Hurley elaborates, “In the bridge of that song, David was
trying to do this thing where he was shuffling around lyric-based
sentences: "Street the up, going girl little crazy..." Bad The John Boy
has this shared idea...instead of 'John the Bad Boy,' it's Bad The John
Boy..."good to up no" (up to no good.  This track is more left of center
than the songs on the full length, with vocals being processed straight
into the spirit realm, sounding deeply non-human.

Complimenting this sci-fi dirge, on the B-side is a Venetian Snares
remix of the album’s title track. Despite the fact that Canadian
electronic musician Aaron Funk has been known for reinventing breakcore,
in this remix he breathes completely new life into this song, turning it
into something far from your typical dance remix.

THE BOOKS  
Title: Freedom From Expression
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: DVD 
 Catalog number: TRR208dvd
Label: Temporary Residence Ltd.
Price: $17.99
  
The Books were one of modern musicʼs most vital players of this
still-young millennium. Over the course of four albums in ten yearsʼ
time, they eschewed genres and pigeonholes so effortlessly and earnestly
that they ultimately pioneered a new genre (or three) in the process.
And for all the speechlessness their recordings inspired, their videos
were every bit as beguiling: a surreal mix of bizarre found footage,
home movies, and psychedelic animated imagery that fit their music so
well that the two became virtually inseparable in their live
performances. Freedom From Expression collects every video ever made by
the Books, compiled in chronological order. Itʼs enormously satisfying
and fulfilling to map the progression from humble bedroom curiosities
through to hilariously warped experimental art films masquerading as
music videos. At over two hours in length across 21 videos, it is an
invaluable piece of the Booksʼ universe, one that demands constant
replays, and delivers as many emotional and cerebral twists and turns as
anything else in their absurdly unique and forward-thinking catalog.

In 2008 double bassist/singer-songwriter Nat Baldwin released Most
Valuable Player, an album that led Pitchfork to say "…he brings fierce
performances to these polished compositions."  Now 5 years later,
Western Vinyl is proud to be releasing the original demos from Most
Valuable Player, which were recorded in 2005 and 2006.

After studying avant-garde jazz and improvisation with jazz legend
Anthony Braxton, Nat Baldwin started writing songs featuring double bass
and vocals.  In 2005 he joined Dirty Projectors.  In addition to his
work with Dirty Projectors, he has performed on Grizzly Bear's Sheilds,
Vampire Weekend's Contra, and Department of Eagles' In Ear Park.  In
between touring and recording with Dirty Projectors, Nat made time to
record his 2011 album People Changes, an album that led Pitchfork to say
"…whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a
thrilling felling of freedom to it all." More recently, he's been
writing, recording, and arranging songs for a new album to be released
in 2014.  You can hear some of the new material live this September when
Nat tours in the US and Canada.

Since he began moonlighting from his main gig as one-half of sci-fi prog
powerhouse Zombi, multi-instrumentalist A.E. Paterra has become
increasingly renowned as the mastermind behind Majeure. Following the
assured debut epic, Timespan, his second album, Solar Maximum,
delivered on the promise of a retro-futurist ambient synth-rock
masterpiece. Romance Language continues this journey with two sprawling,
side-long tracks that marry the sci-fi disco of Timespan with the
celestial Mars-scapes of Solar Maximum. It is both a nod to Majeure's
prior accomplishments, and a peek into his sunspot-bright future –
fitting for an artist whose entire career has been devoted to fluidly
melding the past and the future to create a transcendent present. This
vinyl-only release is strictly limited to 1,000 copies, and includes a
free MP3 download coupon.

"Slippery Slope"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmualauuqmuaaaweagamjjsw/click.php> 
   
In July of 2012, RVNG Intl. was invited to participate in Bulletin
Boards, a group exhibition at Venus Over Manhattan curated by White
Columns’ gallery director Matthew Higgs. An extension of an ongoing
project which resides in the entrance of White Columns’ downtown New
York gallery, Bulletin Boards featured 24 artists/entities, each given a
new bulletin board as an inspirational starting point. In 1981, David
Van Tieghem produced the experimental music video Ear To The Ground. The
film features Van Tieghem “playing” downtown New York City, a world in
which Van Tieghem established his rhythmic roots as a member of the Love
Of Life Orchestra, a frequent collaborator with Laurie Anderson, and a
player on Steve Reich’s Music For 18 Musicians, Robert Ashley’s Perfect
Lives (Private Parts) / Perfect Lives and David Byrne and Brian Eno’s My
Life in the Bush With Ghosts among other seminal recordings including
his own. In Ear To The Ground, all city surfaces become communications—
or bulletins—under Van Tieghem’s twiddling, thwacking and thumping
thumbs. Partially inspired by this and by our blank but physically
limited canvas space, Van Tieghem agreed to take part in a sequence of
improvised performances and creative editing to become part of our
FRKWYS series. We also invited ten younger musicians to post objects to
the board. A cross section of present day New York artists were
represented by way of Sam Hillmer as Diamond Terrifier (with the aid of
Max Alper), Future Shuttle, Georgia, Roberto Carlos Lange as Helado
Negro, Darren Ho, Eli Keszler, Hiro Kone and Megafortress, alongside the
regionally sympathetic Blanche Blanche Blanche and Maxmillion Dunbar. In
place of business cards, broadsheets, and flyers, the
objects/communications contributed were broken toasters, firecrackers,
2x4s, thunder drums and customized electronics, each intended as a
percussive device. On opening night, the bulletin board, disguised as
assemblage, welcomed David’s dialogue. In the spirit of Ear To The
Ground’s infinite conversation, Van Tieghem returned to Venus Over
Manhattan to “play” the bulletin board without an audience. The process
of Van Tieghem discovering and responding to the objects/bulletins again
was multitracked in high definition. These recordings were then
presented to the ten contributing musicians for further translation,
“remix” and interpretation. For the final sequence, the unique pieces
were delivered to Van Tieghem to edit and embellish as the sound
collages presented as Fits & Starts across two album length sides of our
tenth volume in the FRKWYS series.

Could Be More As You Are"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmmanauuqmuagaweafamjjsw/click.php> 


Saâda Bonaire, the fantastic German disco/world music project from
Bremen which never was meant to be. Formed by Bremen DJ Ralf Behrendt in
1982, Saâda Bonaire was a unique concept band centered around two sultry
female vocalists (Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld) and dozens of
local musicians culled from the local immigration center. Originally
signed to EMI in 1982, their first and only single, “You Could Be More
As You Are” was produced by legendary Matumbi, Slits and Pop Group
producer Dennis Bovell in Kraftwerk's studio in Cologne. Its fusion of
husky female vocals, Eastern instruments, dub and African music
aesthetics, drum computers and synthesizers remains unique to this day.
EMI cancelled the project upon its release.

Saâda Bonaire compiles two songs from the original EMI single plus
eleven previously unreleased songs recorded between 1982 and 1985. Also
included are never before published photos and in depth interviews with
band members and a full gate fold cover for those dedicated vinyl
buyers.

Saâda Bonaire. A bizarre mix of Kraftwerk, Grace Jones, and Marlene
Dietrich. These lost recordings from the early eighties still sound
fresh on today's dance floor.

  Shannon Fields (Stars Like Fleas founder/producer) has spent the
better part of the past three years recording new, unhinged,
narratively-oblique, club-centric, dark kitchen-sink pop music under the
name Leverage Models. Following the release of three EPs (digitally, as
well as on limited edition cassettes), Leverage Models will release its
self-titled debut album on Hometapes this fall. The album features
contributions from members of Yeasayer, Sinkane, and LCD Soundsystem, as
well as Sharon Van Etten. The Brooklyn-based live band inhabits the
warped echoes of ABC, Scritti Politti, The Associates, Happy Mondays,
Japan, A Certain Ratio, Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam, Throbbing Gristle,
etc.

For a collection of music built around the poignant inevitability of
decay, there has been a great many hopeful and inspired words devoted to
William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops: stunning, ethereal,
majestic, transfixing, life-affirming… and for good reason. From its
20-year gestation period to its infamously fateful completion, The
Disintegration Loops is one of the most powerful manifestations of the
inevitable cycle of life ever committed to tape, even as it documents
the inevitable decay of all that is committed to tape. The very passage
of time is its most effective instrument. To mark the 10-year
anniversary of its original release – and its forthcoming induction into
the 9/11 Memorial Museum this year – Temporary Residence Ltd. is honored
to collaborate with William Basinski in presenting The Disintegration
Loops in a fashion truly befitting a library of music with such a
lasting legacy. This breathtaking limited-edition, numbered box set
contains all four historic volumes, plus a pair of stunning live
orchestral performances from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the
54th Venice Biennale, both previously unreleased. Remastered from the
original recordings, this exquisite box set also includes the extremely
rare 63-minute The Disintegration Loops film on DVD, and a 148-page
fullcolor book featuring rare photos taken during the making of The
Disintegration Loops, and liner notes by Basinski, Antony, David Tibet
of Current 93, Ronen Givony of the Wordless Music Series, and Michael
Shulan, Creative Director of the National September 11 Memorial Museum.

PENNY PENNY

Title: Shaka Bundu
Release date: 11/12/13

"Shichangani" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mqubaoauuqmuacaweafamjjsw/click.php>
The story of South African singer and dancer Penny Penny is fit for
Hollywood. A nearly homeless janitor with no education gets a record
deal, becomes a multi-platinum-selling pop star, plays stadiums across
Africa, then builds a career as a politician for Mandela's African
National Congress party. Penny Penny's debut recording Shaka Bundu,
recorded in 1994, is the album that took a 34-year-old Giyani Kulani
Kobane from the streets of Johannesburg to the chambers of power. After
a chance meeting with Tsonga disco producer Joe Shirimani, just six
months after apartheid was lifted, Penny Penny's Shaka Bundu was
released and entered the consciousness of the entire country. Penny
Penny became an immediate sensation, against the expectations of
everyone involved. The album went on to sell more than 250,000 copies in
South Africa and Penny Penny has played to thousands on stadium stages
from Liberia and Sierra Leone to Namibia and Mozambique. The music was
something new for Tsonga disco. Slow house music rhythms became the
foundation for Penny's anthemic exultations. Using Atari computers, Korg
M1 synthesizer and reel-to-reel tape for vocals, Penny and Shirimani cut
the entire record in just seven days. Their signature bass sound
combined richness and sharpness with the root tones of an organ. Penny's
rap-like delivery became his calling card: a husky, playful vocal
performance heavy on vibes. Nearly 20 years since Shaka Bundu blasted
from speakers across a newly free South Africa, the music still sounds
big and worldly. And, despite shifting his energies from stadium shows
to municipal matters, Penny Penny still sports his signature top-bun
hairstyle.

"Abscondence" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mquwatauuqmuaiawearamjjsw/click.php>
Hinterland is another step forward in Berlin-based producer Recondite's
progression, maintaining a style all his own and acknowledging the
finest moments in his previous releases. It's no small feat to
incorporate one's observations of human nature against nature, and to
lay it out in such a way that is cohesive, linear and sonically
beautiful both up close and from a distance. "Characteristics of
people's minds," he says. "Such as satisfied, frightened, calm,
melancholic, sad, stoic, frustrated, strong, deep…they are captured in
the sounds."

Recondite's production career has only spanned a handful of years, but
his versatility with electronic music as an expressive medium puts him
beyond others with discographies twice as long. Lush, gorgeous, and
vibrant are three words that can often describe his original
productions, whether it's floating in a beatless ambience or driving a
hard rhythm through the soundsystem of a nightclub or warehouse.

Sinuous ecometric rhythms and dense rain-blown tone sculptures shine and
wind between electrified cotton-nodes, all careening, sliding, colliding
across and through a synaptic panorama. Peninsula-based KILN are Kevin
Hayes on pulse, tump, tick with Kirk Marrison and Clark Rehberg III on
hue, shape and spark. After a decade of genre spinning and attention
spent fusing live organikas with binary tumbleweeds, KILN settles into a
new neurologic with their upcoming release this spring on Ghostly. Not
only for the headphone set, KILN’s recent intent has been on finding the
intuitive fulcrum of gentle momentum invigoration and hyperacoustic
digi-texture chromatics as suited for a wider listening environment.
Kiln’s latest humanist gallery will appeal to any and all who lust for
fine sound form.

<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqeeatauuqmuanaweazamjjsw/click.php> 
 
The hallmark of Jason Molina's career, Magnolia Electric Co., is both a
confluence of all he would create and a line in the sand to mark a shift
in his songwriting approach. It was the last statement under his iconic
Songs: Ohia moniker, and the moment before he began making new legends
as Magnolia Electric Co. for the next 10 years. Now— here at the end of
that decade — with Molina gone, his work gathers more weight and
meaning. This expanded 10-year anniversary edition of Magnolia Electric
Co. features one never-before-released track plus many rarities. The
full-band studio outtake of fan favorite "Whip Poor Will" is a sweet and
spare version that ended up being played far differently on Magnolia
Electric Co.'s final album Josephine (2009). Also included is the studio
version of "The Big Game Is Every Night." Previously only available on
the Japanese version of the album, this opus serves as Molina's thesis
statement, its poetry weaving through the 20th Century, through art and
sporting culture — ultimately questioning what it means to be an
American in the autumn of the American Era. The edition also gathers
Molina's gutting demos for the record, including those two outtakes.
Nearly each begins with audible sound of the RECORD button being pressed
down on the tape player. They are so close and intimate, it's hard to
look them right in the eyes. But you should.

Release date: 11/12/13
Format: CD/LP
Catalog number: SBR100cd/lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $12.99/$16.99
 
2007.  The cover art for 1st record Sacred Bones released depicted an
androgynous wild banshee wearing warpaint, clad all in leather and
animal bones, holding a sacrificial knife pointed at the sky. Our debut
single was The Hunt's lone statement.  The songs were a visceral
pulsation, etched in echo. London, structure fires and mental
institutions all played a part in the downfall of the originators of
21st century redskin darkwave.

2009. After multiple tumultuous attempts at recording a full length The
Hunt decamped to their collective hometown, Boston, to record the
ultimate document of their time on earth. This document sat for years,
untouched by human hands.

2013. The Hunt lives on. In honor of both the first and one hundredth
release, we will finally see and hear the toils of New York's most
enigmatic post punk band of recent. Ian Danger, percussive wunderkind,
Mike O'Brien, whose four strings drew blood nightly, Christian Kount,
master of negative space and Jasper McGandy, the man who's hopes for a
darker future led them towards a reality we only now have the honor of
witnessing. After all these years the time has come. The Hunt Begins.

Cian Nugent is a guitar player from Dublin, Ireland whose music combines
personal passions, such as suburban/coastal blues, traditional music,
1960s & ’70s singer-songwriters, psychedelic rock,critically jazz
ambitions and 20th century composition. Born With The Caul is his first
full length with 4 piece-band The Cosmos and follows his acclaimed 2011
solo effort Doubles. Like that album, Caul is comprised of a few
expansive, developed pieces (three, to be exact). Led by Nugent’s guitar
playing – always inviting, subdued and unpredictable – the band takes
these songs into darker, richer territories opening a whole new galaxy
for this young guitar player to explore.

YEASAYER

Title: Good Evening Washington D.C., Live at 9:30 Club
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 2xLP 

Catalog number: SC302lp 
Label: Secretly Canadian
Price: $19.99

 
 


Yeasayer has seen the road more than the average band.  In just three
albums they have played well over 600 shows in 5 continents.  They've
played to 5, they've played to 35,000. Shows have been great, good, bad,
and a few just terrible.  Gear has been left on tarmacs, computers lost
in taxis, fights, firings, bonds broken and made, and fans gained show
by show.  It's an arduous process being a modern band, but throughout it
all Yeasayer has become one of the best touring acts out there.

Good Evening Washington DC, Live at 9:30 Club was recorded on the
Fragrant World Tour during a sold out two-night stand on November 14th +
15th, 2012.  A fitting location seeing as members of the band used to go
to shows at the 9:30 Club when they were teenagers.  Much like the
band’s first live album, Live at Ancienne Belqique, this recording was
created specifically with Yeasayer fans in mind.  

With that said, over the years it's become evident that the live show,
for many, is the gateway to understanding the band, their music, and
their varied albums.  Sonically shifting record to record, Yeasayer are
able to incorporate songs from all three albums into an incredibly
cohesive live show.  The songs aren't played verbatim.  Rather, even for
the avid Yeasayer fan, they are transformed in to something fresh and
different.

Though this is the first time the band is putting a live event into
physical form, the hope is there will be more opportunities down the
road as live recording gets more affordable.

DAVID LYNCH

Title: Bad The John Boy
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 12”
Catalog number: SBR110lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $10.99


On the heels of David Lynch’s hugely successful sophomore full length,
The Big Dream, comes a very limited edition 12”, Bad The John Boy. While
technically this track qualifies as a non-album or bonus track, this
song was made around the same time as the track, We Rolled Together.
Producer Dean Hurley elaborates, “In the bridge of that song, David was
trying to do this thing where he was shuffling around lyric-based
sentences: "Street the up, going girl little crazy..." Bad The John Boy
has this shared idea...instead of 'John the Bad Boy,' it's Bad The John
Boy..."good to up no" (up to no good.  This track is more left of center
than the songs on the full length, with vocals being processed straight
into the spirit realm, sounding deeply non-human.

Complimenting this sci-fi dirge, on the B-side is a Venetian Snares
remix of the album’s title track. Despite the fact that Canadian
electronic musician Aaron Funk has been known for reinventing breakcore,
in this remix he breathes completely new life into this song, turning it
into something far from your typical dance remix.

THE BOOKS  
Title: Freedom From Expression
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: DVD 
 Catalog number: TRR208dvd
Label: Temporary Residence Ltd.
Price: $17.99
  
The Books were one of modern musicʼs most vital players of this
still-young millennium. Over the course of four albums in ten yearsʼ
time, they eschewed genres and pigeonholes so effortlessly and earnestly
that they ultimately pioneered a new genre (or three) in the process.
And for all the speechlessness their recordings inspired, their videos
were every bit as beguiling: a surreal mix of bizarre found footage,
home movies, and psychedelic animated imagery that fit their music so
well that the two became virtually inseparable in their live
performances. Freedom From Expression collects every video ever made by
the Books, compiled in chronological order. Itʼs enormously satisfying
and fulfilling to map the progression from humble bedroom curiosities
through to hilariously warped experimental art films masquerading as
music videos. At over two hours in length across 21 videos, it is an
invaluable piece of the Booksʼ universe, one that demands constant
replays, and delivers as many emotional and cerebral twists and turns as
anything else in their absurdly unique and forward-thinking catalog.

"Lake Erie" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mqewakauuqmuacaweazamjjsw/click.php> 


In 2008 double bassist/singer-songwriter Nat Baldwin released Most
Valuable Player, an album that led Pitchfork to say "…he brings fierce
performances to these polished compositions."  Now 5 years later,
Western Vinyl is proud to be releasing the original demos from Most
Valuable Player, which were recorded in 2005 and 2006.

After studying avant-garde jazz and improvisation with jazz legend
Anthony Braxton, Nat Baldwin started writing songs featuring double bass
and vocals.  In 2005 he joined Dirty Projectors.  In addition to his
work with Dirty Projectors, he has performed on Grizzly Bear's Sheilds,
Vampire Weekend's Contra, and Department of Eagles' In Ear Park.  In
between touring and recording with Dirty Projectors, Nat made time to
record his 2011 album People Changes, an album that led Pitchfork to say
"…whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a
thrilling felling of freedom to it all." More recently, he's been
writing, recording, and arranging songs for a new album to be released
in 2014.  You can hear some of the new material live this September when
Nat tours in the US and Canada.

Since he began moonlighting from his main gig as one-half of sci-fi prog
powerhouse Zombi, multi-instrumentalist A.E. Paterra has become
increasingly renowned as the mastermind behind Majeure. Following the
assured debut epic, Timespan, his second album, Solar Maximum,
delivered on the promise of a retro-futurist ambient synth-rock
masterpiece. Romance Language continues this journey with two sprawling,
side-long tracks that marry the sci-fi disco of Timespan with the
celestial Mars-scapes of Solar Maximum. It is both a nod to Majeure's
prior accomplishments, and a peek into his sunspot-bright future –
fitting for an artist whose entire career has been devoted to fluidly
melding the past and the future to create a transcendent present. This
vinyl-only release is strictly limited to 1,000 copies, and includes a
free MP3 download coupon.

"Slippery Slope"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmualauuqmuaaaweagamjjsw/click.php> 
   
In July of 2012, RVNG Intl. was invited to participate in Bulletin
Boards, a group exhibition at Venus Over Manhattan curated by White
Columns’ gallery director Matthew Higgs. An extension of an ongoing
project which resides in the entrance of White Columns’ downtown New
York gallery, Bulletin Boards featured 24 artists/entities, each given a
new bulletin board as an inspirational starting point. In 1981, David
Van Tieghem produced the experimental music video Ear To The Ground. The
film features Van Tieghem “playing” downtown New York City, a world in
which Van Tieghem established his rhythmic roots as a member of the Love
Of Life Orchestra, a frequent collaborator with Laurie Anderson, and a
player on Steve Reich’s Music For 18 Musicians, Robert Ashley’s Perfect
Lives (Private Parts) / Perfect Lives and David Byrne and Brian Eno’s My
Life in the Bush With Ghosts among other seminal recordings including
his own. In Ear To The Ground, all city surfaces become communications—
or bulletins—under Van Tieghem’s twiddling, thwacking and thumping
thumbs. Partially inspired by this and by our blank but physically
limited canvas space, Van Tieghem agreed to take part in a sequence of
improvised performances and creative editing to become part of our
FRKWYS series. We also invited ten younger musicians to post objects to
the board. A cross section of present day New York artists were
represented by way of Sam Hillmer as Diamond Terrifier (with the aid of
Max Alper), Future Shuttle, Georgia, Roberto Carlos Lange as Helado
Negro, Darren Ho, Eli Keszler, Hiro Kone and Megafortress, alongside the
regionally sympathetic Blanche Blanche Blanche and Maxmillion Dunbar. In
place of business cards, broadsheets, and flyers, the
objects/communications contributed were broken toasters, firecrackers,
2x4s, thunder drums and customized electronics, each intended as a
percussive device. On opening night, the bulletin board, disguised as
assemblage, welcomed David’s dialogue. In the spirit of Ear To The
Ground’s infinite conversation, Van Tieghem returned to Venus Over
Manhattan to “play” the bulletin board without an audience. The process
of Van Tieghem discovering and responding to the objects/bulletins again
was multitracked in high definition. These recordings were then
presented to the ten contributing musicians for further translation,
“remix” and interpretation. For the final sequence, the unique pieces
were delivered to Van Tieghem to edit and embellish as the sound
collages presented as Fits & Starts across two album length sides of our
tenth volume in the FRKWYS series.

<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmmanauuqmuagaweafamjjsw/click.php> 


Saâda Bonaire, the fantastic German disco/world music project from
Bremen which never was meant to be. Formed by Bremen DJ Ralf Behrendt in
1982, Saâda Bonaire was a unique concept band centered around two sultry
female vocalists (Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld) and dozens of
local musicians culled from the local immigration center. Originally
signed to EMI in 1982, their first and only single, “You Could Be More
As You Are” was produced by legendary Matumbi, Slits and Pop Group
producer Dennis Bovell in Kraftwerk's studio in Cologne. Its fusion of
husky female vocals, Eastern instruments, dub and African music
aesthetics, drum computers and synthesizers remains unique to this day.
EMI cancelled the project upon its release.

Saâda Bonaire compiles two songs from the original EMI single plus
eleven previously unreleased songs recorded between 1982 and 1985. Also
included are never before published photos and in depth interviews with
band members and a full gate fold cover for those dedicated vinyl
buyers.

Saâda Bonaire. A bizarre mix of Kraftwerk, Grace Jones, and Marlene
Dietrich. These lost recordings from the early eighties still sound
fresh on today's dance floor.

  Shannon Fields (Stars Like Fleas founder/producer) has spent the
better part of the past three years recording new, unhinged,

name Leverage Models. Following the release of three EPs (digitally, as
well as on limited edition cassettes), Leverage Models will release its
self-titled debut album on Hometapes this fall. The album features
contributions from members of Yeasayer, Sinkane, and LCD Soundsystem, as
well as Sharon Van Etten. The Brooklyn-based live band inhabits the
warped echoes of ABC, Scritti Politti, The Associates, Happy Mondays,
Japan, A Certain Ratio, Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam, Throbbing Gristle,
etc.

For a collection of music built around the poignant inevitability of
decay, there has been a great many hopeful and inspired words devoted to
William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops: stunning, ethereal,
majestic, transfixing, life-affirming… and for good reason. From its
20-year gestation period to its infamously fateful completion, The
Disintegration Loops is one of the most powerful manifestations of the
inevitable cycle of life ever committed to tape, even as it documents
the inevitable decay of all that is committed to tape. The very passage
of time is its most effective instrument. To mark the 10-year
anniversary of its original release – and its forthcoming induction into
the 9/11 Memorial Museum this year – Temporary Residence Ltd. is honored
to collaborate with William Basinski in presenting The Disintegration
Loops in a fashion truly befitting a library of music with such a
lasting legacy. This breathtaking limited-edition, numbered box set
contains all four historic volumes, plus a pair of stunning live
orchestral performances from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the
54th Venice Biennale, both previously unreleased. Remastered from the
original recordings, this exquisite box set also includes the extremely
rare 63-minute The Disintegration Loops film on DVD, and a 148-page
fullcolor book featuring rare photos taken during the making of The
Disintegration Loops, and liner notes by Basinski, Antony, David Tibet
of Current 93, Ronen Givony of the Wordless Music Series, and Michael
Shulan, Creative Director of the National September 11 Memorial Museum.

"Shichangani" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mqubaoauuqmuacaweafamjjsw/click.php>
The story of South African singer and dancer Penny Penny is fit for
Hollywood. A nearly homeless janitor with no education gets a record
deal, becomes a multi-platinum-selling pop star, plays stadiums across
Africa, then builds a career as a politician for Mandela's African
National Congress party. Penny Penny's debut recording Shaka Bundu,
recorded in 1994, is the album that took a 34-year-old Giyani Kulani
Kobane from the streets of Johannesburg to the chambers of power. After
a chance meeting with Tsonga disco producer Joe Shirimani, just six
months after apartheid was lifted, Penny Penny's Shaka Bundu was
released and entered the consciousness of the entire country. Penny
Penny became an immediate sensation, against the expectations of
everyone involved. The album went on to sell more than 250,000 copies in
South Africa and Penny Penny has played to thousands on stadium stages
from Liberia and Sierra Leone to Namibia and Mozambique. The music was
something new for Tsonga disco. Slow house music rhythms became the
foundation for Penny's anthemic exultations. Using Atari computers, Korg
M1 synthesizer and reel-to-reel tape for vocals, Penny and Shirimani cut
the entire record in just seven days. Their signature bass sound
combined richness and sharpness with the root tones of an organ. Penny's
rap-like delivery became his calling card: a husky, playful vocal
performance heavy on vibes. Nearly 20 years since Shaka Bundu blasted
from speakers across a newly free South Africa, the music still sounds
big and worldly. And, despite shifting his energies from stadium shows
to municipal matters, Penny Penny still sports his signature top-bun
hairstyle.

"Abscondence" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mquwatauuqmuaiawearamjjsw/click.php>
Hinterland is another step forward in Berlin-based producer Recondite's
progression, maintaining a style all his own and acknowledging the
finest moments in his previous releases. It's no small feat to
incorporate one's observations of human nature against nature, and to
lay it out in such a way that is cohesive, linear and sonically
beautiful both up close and from a distance. "Characteristics of
people's minds," he says. "Such as satisfied, frightened, calm,
melancholic, sad, stoic, frustrated, strong, deep…they are captured in
the sounds."

Recondite's production career has only spanned a handful of years, but
his versatility with electronic music as an expressive medium puts him
beyond others with discographies twice as long. Lush, gorgeous, and
vibrant are three words that can often describe his original
productions, whether it's floating in a beatless ambience or driving a
hard rhythm through the soundsystem of a nightclub or warehouse.

Sinuous ecometric rhythms and dense rain-blown tone sculptures shine and
wind between electrified cotton-nodes, all careening, sliding, colliding
across and through a synaptic panorama. Peninsula-based KILN are Kevin
Hayes on pulse, tump, tick with Kirk Marrison and Clark Rehberg III on
hue, shape and spark. After a decade of genre spinning and attention
spent fusing live organikas with binary tumbleweeds, KILN settles into a
new neurologic with their upcoming release this spring on Ghostly. Not
only for the headphone set, KILN’s recent intent has been on finding the
intuitive fulcrum of gentle momentum invigoration and hyperacoustic
digi-texture chromatics as suited for a wider listening environment.
Kiln’s latest humanist gallery will appeal to any and all who lust for
fine sound form.

<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqeeatauuqmuanaweazamjjsw/click.php> 
 
The hallmark of Jason Molina's career, Magnolia Electric Co., is both a
confluence of all he would create and a line in the sand to mark a shift
in his songwriting approach. It was the last statement under his iconic
Songs: Ohia moniker, and the moment before he began making new legends
as Magnolia Electric Co. for the next 10 years. Now— here at the end of
that decade — with Molina gone, his work gathers more weight and
meaning. This expanded 10-year anniversary edition of Magnolia Electric
Co. features one never-before-released track plus many rarities. The
full-band studio outtake of fan favorite "Whip Poor Will" is a sweet and
spare version that ended up being played far differently on Magnolia
Electric Co.'s final album Josephine (2009). Also included is the studio
version of "The Big Game Is Every Night." Previously only available on
the Japanese version of the album, this opus serves as Molina's thesis
statement, its poetry weaving through the 20th Century, through art and
sporting culture — ultimately questioning what it means to be an
American in the autumn of the American Era. The edition also gathers
Molina's gutting demos for the record, including those two outtakes.
Nearly each begins with audible sound of the RECORD button being pressed
down on the tape player. They are so close and intimate, it's hard to
look them right in the eyes. But you should.

Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $12.99/$16.99
 
2007.  The cover art for 1st record Sacred Bones released depicted an
androgynous wild banshee wearing warpaint, clad all in leather and
animal bones, holding a sacrificial knife pointed at the sky. Our debut
single was The Hunt's lone statement.  The songs were a visceral
pulsation, etched in echo. London, structure fires and mental
institutions all played a part in the downfall of the originators of
21st century redskin darkwave.

2009. After multiple tumultuous attempts at recording a full length The
Hunt decamped to their collective hometown, Boston, to record the
ultimate document of their time on earth. This document sat for years,
untouched by human hands.

2013. The Hunt lives on. In honor of both the first and one hundredth
release, we will finally see and hear the toils of New York's most
enigmatic post punk band of recent. Ian Danger, percussive wunderkind,
Mike O'Brien, whose four strings drew blood nightly, Christian Kount,
master of negative space and Jasper McGandy, the man who's hopes for a
darker future led them towards a reality we only now have the honor of
witnessing. After all these years the time has come. The Hunt Begins.

"Grass Above My Head"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqebadauuqmuaxaweaxamjjsw/click.php> 

Cian Nugent is a guitar player from Dublin, Ireland whose music combines
personal passions, such as suburban/coastal blues, traditional music,
1960s & ’70s singer-songwriters, psychedelic rock,critically jazz
ambitions and 20th century composition. Born With The Caul is his first
full length with 4 piece-band The Cosmos and follows his acclaimed 2011
solo effort Doubles. Like that album, Caul is comprised of a few
expansive, developed pieces (three, to be exact). Led by Nugent’s guitar
playing – always inviting, subdued and unpredictable – the band takes
these songs into darker, richer territories opening a whole new galaxy
for this young guitar player to explore.

YEASAYER

Title: Good Evening Washington D.C., Live at 9:30 Club
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 2xLP 

Catalog number: SC302lp 
Label: Secretly Canadian
Price: $19.99

 
 


Yeasayer has seen the road more than the average band.  In just three
albums they have played well over 600 shows in 5 continents.  They've
played to 5, they've played to 35,000. Shows have been great, good, bad,
and a few just terrible.  Gear has been left on tarmacs, computers lost
in taxis, fights, firings, bonds broken and made, and fans gained show
by show.  It's an arduous process being a modern band, but throughout it
all Yeasayer has become one of the best touring acts out there.

Good Evening Washington DC, Live at 9:30 Club was recorded on the
Fragrant World Tour during a sold out two-night stand on November 14th +
15th, 2012.  A fitting location seeing as members of the band used to go
to shows at the 9:30 Club when they were teenagers.  Much like the
band’s first live album, Live at Ancienne Belqique, this recording was
created specifically with Yeasayer fans in mind.  

With that said, over the years it's become evident that the live show,
for many, is the gateway to understanding the band, their music, and
their varied albums.  Sonically shifting record to record, Yeasayer are
able to incorporate songs from all three albums into an incredibly
cohesive live show.  The songs aren't played verbatim.  Rather, even for
the avid Yeasayer fan, they are transformed in to something fresh and
different.

Though this is the first time the band is putting a live event into
physical form, the hope is there will be more opportunities down the
road as live recording gets more affordable.

DAVID LYNCH

Title: Bad The John Boy
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 12”
Catalog number: SBR110lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $10.99


On the heels of David Lynch’s hugely successful sophomore full length,
The Big Dream, comes a very limited edition 12”, Bad The John Boy. While
technically this track qualifies as a non-album or bonus track, this
song was made around the same time as the track, We Rolled Together.
Producer Dean Hurley elaborates, “In the bridge of that song, David was
trying to do this thing where he was shuffling around lyric-based
sentences: "Street the up, going girl little crazy..." Bad The John Boy
has this shared idea...instead of 'John the Bad Boy,' it's Bad The John
Boy..."good to up no" (up to no good.  This track is more left of center
than the songs on the full length, with vocals being processed straight
into the spirit realm, sounding deeply non-human.

Complimenting this sci-fi dirge, on the B-side is a Venetian Snares
remix of the album’s title track. Despite the fact that Canadian
electronic musician Aaron Funk has been known for reinventing breakcore,
in this remix he breathes completely new life into this song, turning it
into something far from your typical dance remix.

THE BOOKS  
Title: Freedom From Expression
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: DVD 
 Catalog number: TRR208dvd
Label: Temporary Residence Ltd.
Price: $17.99
  
The Books were one of modern musicʼs most vital players of this
still-young millennium. Over the course of four albums in ten yearsʼ
time, they eschewed genres and pigeonholes so effortlessly and earnestly
that they ultimately pioneered a new genre (or three) in the process.
And for all the speechlessness their recordings inspired, their videos
were every bit as beguiling: a surreal mix of bizarre found footage,
home movies, and psychedelic animated imagery that fit their music so
well that the two became virtually inseparable in their live
performances. Freedom From Expression collects every video ever made by
the Books, compiled in chronological order. Itʼs enormously satisfying
and fulfilling to map the progression from humble bedroom curiosities
through to hilariously warped experimental art films masquerading as
music videos. At over two hours in length across 21 videos, it is an
invaluable piece of the Booksʼ universe, one that demands constant
replays, and delivers as many emotional and cerebral twists and turns as
anything else in their absurdly unique and forward-thinking catalog.

In 2008 double bassist/singer-songwriter Nat Baldwin released Most
Valuable Player, an album that led Pitchfork to say "…he brings fierce
performances to these polished compositions."  Now 5 years later,
Western Vinyl is proud to be releasing the original demos from Most
Valuable Player, which were recorded in 2005 and 2006.

After studying avant-garde jazz and improvisation with jazz legend
Anthony Braxton, Nat Baldwin started writing songs featuring double bass
and vocals.  In 2005 he joined Dirty Projectors.  In addition to his
work with Dirty Projectors, he has performed on Grizzly Bear's Sheilds,
Vampire Weekend's Contra, and Department of Eagles' In Ear Park.  In
between touring and recording with Dirty Projectors, Nat made time to
record his 2011 album People Changes, an album that led Pitchfork to say
"…whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a
thrilling felling of freedom to it all." More recently, he's been
writing, recording, and arranging songs for a new album to be released
in 2014.  You can hear some of the new material live this September when
Nat tours in the US and Canada.

Since he began moonlighting from his main gig as one-half of sci-fi prog
powerhouse Zombi, multi-instrumentalist A.E. Paterra has become
increasingly renowned as the mastermind behind Majeure. Following the
assured debut epic, Timespan, his second album, Solar Maximum,
delivered on the promise of a retro-futurist ambient synth-rock
masterpiece. Romance Language continues this journey with two sprawling,
side-long tracks that marry the sci-fi disco of Timespan with the
celestial Mars-scapes of Solar Maximum. It is both a nod to Majeure's
prior accomplishments, and a peek into his sunspot-bright future –
fitting for an artist whose entire career has been devoted to fluidly
melding the past and the future to create a transcendent present. This
vinyl-only release is strictly limited to 1,000 copies, and includes a
free MP3 download coupon.

"Slippery Slope"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmualauuqmuaaaweagamjjsw/click.php> 
   
In July of 2012, RVNG Intl. was invited to participate in Bulletin
Boards, a group exhibition at Venus Over Manhattan curated by White
Columns’ gallery director Matthew Higgs. An extension of an ongoing
project which resides in the entrance of White Columns’ downtown New
York gallery, Bulletin Boards featured 24 artists/entities, each given a
new bulletin board as an inspirational starting point. In 1981, David
Van Tieghem produced the experimental music video Ear To The Ground. The
film features Van Tieghem “playing” downtown New York City, a world in
which Van Tieghem established his rhythmic roots as a member of the Love
Of Life Orchestra, a frequent collaborator with Laurie Anderson, and a
player on Steve Reich’s Music For 18 Musicians, Robert Ashley’s Perfect
Lives (Private Parts) / Perfect Lives and David Byrne and Brian Eno’s My
Life in the Bush With Ghosts among other seminal recordings including
his own. In Ear To The Ground, all city surfaces become communications—
or bulletins—under Van Tieghem’s twiddling, thwacking and thumping
thumbs. Partially inspired by this and by our blank but physically
limited canvas space, Van Tieghem agreed to take part in a sequence of
improvised performances and creative editing to become part of our
FRKWYS series. We also invited ten younger musicians to post objects to
the board. A cross section of present day New York artists were
represented by way of Sam Hillmer as Diamond Terrifier (with the aid of
Max Alper), Future Shuttle, Georgia, Roberto Carlos Lange as Helado
Negro, Darren Ho, Eli Keszler, Hiro Kone and Megafortress, alongside the
regionally sympathetic Blanche Blanche Blanche and Maxmillion Dunbar. In
place of business cards, broadsheets, and flyers, the
objects/communications contributed were broken toasters, firecrackers,
2x4s, thunder drums and customized electronics, each intended as a
percussive device. On opening night, the bulletin board, disguised as
assemblage, welcomed David’s dialogue. In the spirit of Ear To The
Ground’s infinite conversation, Van Tieghem returned to Venus Over
Manhattan to “play” the bulletin board without an audience. The process
of Van Tieghem discovering and responding to the objects/bulletins again
was multitracked in high definition. These recordings were then
presented to the ten contributing musicians for further translation,
“remix” and interpretation. For the final sequence, the unique pieces
were delivered to Van Tieghem to edit and embellish as the sound
collages presented as Fits & Starts across two album length sides of our
tenth volume in the FRKWYS series.

Saâda Bonaire, the fantastic German disco/world music project from
Bremen which never was meant to be. Formed by Bremen DJ Ralf Behrendt in
1982, Saâda Bonaire was a unique concept band centered around two sultry
female vocalists (Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld) and dozens of
local musicians culled from the local immigration center. Originally
signed to EMI in 1982, their first and only single, “You Could Be More
As You Are” was produced by legendary Matumbi, Slits and Pop Group
producer Dennis Bovell in Kraftwerk's studio in Cologne. Its fusion of
husky female vocals, Eastern instruments, dub and African music
aesthetics, drum computers and synthesizers remains unique to this day.
EMI cancelled the project upon its release.

Saâda Bonaire compiles two songs from the original EMI single plus
eleven previously unreleased songs recorded between 1982 and 1985. Also
included are never before published photos and in depth interviews with
band members and a full gate fold cover for those dedicated vinyl
buyers.

Saâda Bonaire. A bizarre mix of Kraftwerk, Grace Jones, and Marlene
Dietrich. These lost recordings from the early eighties still sound
fresh on today's dance floor.

well as on limited edition cassettes), Leverage Models will release its
self-titled debut album on Hometapes this fall. The album features
contributions from members of Yeasayer, Sinkane, and LCD Soundsystem, as
well as Sharon Van Etten. The Brooklyn-based live band inhabits the
warped echoes of ABC, Scritti Politti, The Associates, Happy Mondays,
Japan, A Certain Ratio, Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam, Throbbing Gristle,
etc.

For a collection of music built around the poignant inevitability of
decay, there has been a great many hopeful and inspired words devoted to
William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops: stunning, ethereal,
majestic, transfixing, life-affirming… and for good reason. From its
20-year gestation period to its infamously fateful completion, The
Disintegration Loops is one of the most powerful manifestations of the
inevitable cycle of life ever committed to tape, even as it documents
the inevitable decay of all that is committed to tape. The very passage
of time is its most effective instrument. To mark the 10-year
anniversary of its original release – and its forthcoming induction into
the 9/11 Memorial Museum this year – Temporary Residence Ltd. is honored
to collaborate with William Basinski in presenting The Disintegration
Loops in a fashion truly befitting a library of music with such a
lasting legacy. This breathtaking limited-edition, numbered box set
contains all four historic volumes, plus a pair of stunning live
orchestral performances from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the
54th Venice Biennale, both previously unreleased. Remastered from the
original recordings, this exquisite box set also includes the extremely
rare 63-minute The Disintegration Loops film on DVD, and a 148-page
fullcolor book featuring rare photos taken during the making of The
Disintegration Loops, and liner notes by Basinski, Antony, David Tibet
of Current 93, Ronen Givony of the Wordless Music Series, and Michael
Shulan, Creative Director of the National September 11 Memorial Museum.

"Shichangani" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mqubaoauuqmuacaweafamjjsw/click.php>
The story of South African singer and dancer Penny Penny is fit for
Hollywood. A nearly homeless janitor with no education gets a record
deal, becomes a multi-platinum-selling pop star, plays stadiums across
Africa, then builds a career as a politician for Mandela's African
National Congress party. Penny Penny's debut recording Shaka Bundu,
recorded in 1994, is the album that took a 34-year-old Giyani Kulani
Kobane from the streets of Johannesburg to the chambers of power. After
a chance meeting with Tsonga disco producer Joe Shirimani, just six
months after apartheid was lifted, Penny Penny's Shaka Bundu was
released and entered the consciousness of the entire country. Penny
Penny became an immediate sensation, against the expectations of
everyone involved. The album went on to sell more than 250,000 copies in
South Africa and Penny Penny has played to thousands on stadium stages
from Liberia and Sierra Leone to Namibia and Mozambique. The music was
something new for Tsonga disco. Slow house music rhythms became the
foundation for Penny's anthemic exultations. Using Atari computers, Korg
M1 synthesizer and reel-to-reel tape for vocals, Penny and Shirimani cut
the entire record in just seven days. Their signature bass sound
combined richness and sharpness with the root tones of an organ. Penny's
rap-like delivery became his calling card: a husky, playful vocal
performance heavy on vibes. Nearly 20 years since Shaka Bundu blasted
from speakers across a newly free South Africa, the music still sounds
big and worldly. And, despite shifting his energies from stadium shows
to municipal matters, Penny Penny still sports his signature top-bun
hairstyle.

"Abscondence" <http://t.ymlp261.net/mquwatauuqmuaiawearamjjsw/click.php>
Hinterland is another step forward in Berlin-based producer Recondite's
progression, maintaining a style all his own and acknowledging the
finest moments in his previous releases. It's no small feat to
incorporate one's observations of human nature against nature, and to
lay it out in such a way that is cohesive, linear and sonically
beautiful both up close and from a distance. "Characteristics of
people's minds," he says. "Such as satisfied, frightened, calm,
melancholic, sad, stoic, frustrated, strong, deep…they are captured in
the sounds."

Recondite's production career has only spanned a handful of years, but
his versatility with electronic music as an expressive medium puts him
beyond others with discographies twice as long. Lush, gorgeous, and
vibrant are three words that can often describe his original
productions, whether it's floating in a beatless ambience or driving a
hard rhythm through the soundsystem of a nightclub or warehouse.

Sinuous ecometric rhythms and dense rain-blown tone sculptures shine and
wind between electrified cotton-nodes, all careening, sliding, colliding
across and through a synaptic panorama. Peninsula-based KILN are Kevin
Hayes on pulse, tump, tick with Kirk Marrison and Clark Rehberg III on
hue, shape and spark. After a decade of genre spinning and attention
spent fusing live organikas with binary tumbleweeds, KILN settles into a
new neurologic with their upcoming release this spring on Ghostly. Not
only for the headphone set, KILN’s recent intent has been on finding the
intuitive fulcrum of gentle momentum invigoration and hyperacoustic
digi-texture chromatics as suited for a wider listening environment.
Kiln’s latest humanist gallery will appeal to any and all who lust for
fine sound form.

<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqeeatauuqmuanaweazamjjsw/click.php> 
 
The hallmark of Jason Molina's career, Magnolia Electric Co., is both a
confluence of all he would create and a line in the sand to mark a shift
in his songwriting approach. It was the last statement under his iconic
Songs: Ohia moniker, and the moment before he began making new legends
as Magnolia Electric Co. for the next 10 years. Now— here at the end of
that decade — with Molina gone, his work gathers more weight and
meaning. This expanded 10-year anniversary edition of Magnolia Electric
Co. features one never-before-released track plus many rarities. The
full-band studio outtake of fan favorite "Whip Poor Will" is a sweet and
spare version that ended up being played far differently on Magnolia
Electric Co.'s final album Josephine (2009). Also included is the studio
version of "The Big Game Is Every Night." Previously only available on
the Japanese version of the album, this opus serves as Molina's thesis
statement, its poetry weaving through the 20th Century, through art and
sporting culture — ultimately questioning what it means to be an
American in the autumn of the American Era. The edition also gathers
Molina's gutting demos for the record, including those two outtakes.
Nearly each begins with audible sound of the RECORD button being pressed
down on the tape player. They are so close and intimate, it's hard to
look them right in the eyes. But you should.

Format: CD/LP
Catalog number: SBR100cd/lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $12.99/$16.99
 
2007.  The cover art for 1st record Sacred Bones released depicted an
androgynous wild banshee wearing warpaint, clad all in leather and
animal bones, holding a sacrificial knife pointed at the sky. Our debut
single was The Hunt's lone statement.  The songs were a visceral
pulsation, etched in echo. London, structure fires and mental
institutions all played a part in the downfall of the originators of
21st century redskin darkwave.

2009. After multiple tumultuous attempts at recording a full length The
Hunt decamped to their collective hometown, Boston, to record the
ultimate document of their time on earth. This document sat for years,
untouched by human hands.

2013. The Hunt lives on. In honor of both the first and one hundredth
release, we will finally see and hear the toils of New York's most
enigmatic post punk band of recent. Ian Danger, percussive wunderkind,
Mike O'Brien, whose four strings drew blood nightly, Christian Kount,
master of negative space and Jasper McGandy, the man who's hopes for a
darker future led them towards a reality we only now have the honor of
witnessing. After all these years the time has come. The Hunt Begins.

<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqebadauuqmuaxaweaxamjjsw/click.php> 

Cian Nugent is a guitar player from Dublin, Ireland whose music combines
personal passions, such as suburban/coastal blues, traditional music,
1960s & ’70s singer-songwriters, psychedelic rock,critically jazz
ambitions and 20th century composition. Born With The Caul is his first
full length with 4 piece-band The Cosmos and follows his acclaimed 2011
solo effort Doubles. Like that album, Caul is comprised of a few
expansive, developed pieces (three, to be exact). Led by Nugent’s guitar
playing – always inviting, subdued and unpredictable – the band takes
these songs into darker, richer territories opening a whole new galaxy
for this young guitar player to explore.

YEASAYER

Title: Good Evening Washington D.C., Live at 9:30 Club
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 2xLP 

Catalog number: SC302lp 
Label: Secretly Canadian
Price: $19.99

 
 


Yeasayer has seen the road more than the average band.  In just three
albums they have played well over 600 shows in 5 continents.  They've
played to 5, they've played to 35,000. Shows have been great, good, bad,
and a few just terrible.  Gear has been left on tarmacs, computers lost
in taxis, fights, firings, bonds broken and made, and fans gained show
by show.  It's an arduous process being a modern band, but throughout it
all Yeasayer has become one of the best touring acts out there.

Good Evening Washington DC, Live at 9:30 Club was recorded on the
Fragrant World Tour during a sold out two-night stand on November 14th +
15th, 2012.  A fitting location seeing as members of the band used to go
to shows at the 9:30 Club when they were teenagers.  Much like the
band’s first live album, Live at Ancienne Belqique, this recording was
created specifically with Yeasayer fans in mind.  

With that said, over the years it's become evident that the live show,
for many, is the gateway to understanding the band, their music, and
their varied albums.  Sonically shifting record to record, Yeasayer are
able to incorporate songs from all three albums into an incredibly
cohesive live show.  The songs aren't played verbatim.  Rather, even for
the avid Yeasayer fan, they are transformed in to something fresh and
different.

Though this is the first time the band is putting a live event into
physical form, the hope is there will be more opportunities down the
road as live recording gets more affordable.

DAVID LYNCH

Title: Bad The John Boy
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: 12”
Catalog number: SBR110lp
Label: Sacred Bones Records
Price: $10.99


On the heels of David Lynch’s hugely successful sophomore full length,
The Big Dream, comes a very limited edition 12”, Bad The John Boy. While
technically this track qualifies as a non-album or bonus track, this
song was made around the same time as the track, We Rolled Together.
Producer Dean Hurley elaborates, “In the bridge of that song, David was
trying to do this thing where he was shuffling around lyric-based
sentences: "Street the up, going girl little crazy..." Bad The John Boy
has this shared idea...instead of 'John the Bad Boy,' it's Bad The John
Boy..."good to up no" (up to no good.  This track is more left of center
than the songs on the full length, with vocals being processed straight
into the spirit realm, sounding deeply non-human.

Complimenting this sci-fi dirge, on the B-side is a Venetian Snares
remix of the album’s title track. Despite the fact that Canadian
electronic musician Aaron Funk has been known for reinventing breakcore,
in this remix he breathes completely new life into this song, turning it
into something far from your typical dance remix.

THE BOOKS  
Title: Freedom From Expression
Release date: 11/12/13
Format: DVD 
 Catalog number: TRR208dvd
Label: Temporary Residence Ltd.
Price: $17.99
  
The Books were one of modern musicʼs most vital players of this
still-young millennium. Over the course of four albums in ten yearsʼ
time, they eschewed genres and pigeonholes so effortlessly and earnestly
that they ultimately pioneered a new genre (or three) in the process.
And for all the speechlessness their recordings inspired, their videos
were every bit as beguiling: a surreal mix of bizarre found footage,
home movies, and psychedelic animated imagery that fit their music so
well that the two became virtually inseparable in their live
performances. Freedom From Expression collects every video ever made by
the Books, compiled in chronological order. Itʼs enormously satisfying
and fulfilling to map the progression from humble bedroom curiosities
through to hilariously warped experimental art films masquerading as
music videos. At over two hours in length across 21 videos, it is an
invaluable piece of the Booksʼ universe, one that demands constant
replays, and delivers as many emotional and cerebral twists and turns as
anything else in their absurdly unique and forward-thinking catalog.

In 2008 double bassist/singer-songwriter Nat Baldwin released Most
Valuable Player, an album that led Pitchfork to say "…he brings fierce
performances to these polished compositions."  Now 5 years later,
Western Vinyl is proud to be releasing the original demos from Most
Valuable Player, which were recorded in 2005 and 2006.

After studying avant-garde jazz and improvisation with jazz legend
Anthony Braxton, Nat Baldwin started writing songs featuring double bass
and vocals.  In 2005 he joined Dirty Projectors.  In addition to his
work with Dirty Projectors, he has performed on Grizzly Bear's Sheilds,
Vampire Weekend's Contra, and Department of Eagles' In Ear Park.  In
between touring and recording with Dirty Projectors, Nat made time to
record his 2011 album People Changes, an album that led Pitchfork to say
"…whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a
thrilling felling of freedom to it all." More recently, he's been
writing, recording, and arranging songs for a new album to be released
in 2014.  You can hear some of the new material live this September when
Nat tours in the US and Canada.

Since he began moonlighting from his main gig as one-half of sci-fi prog
powerhouse Zombi, multi-instrumentalist A.E. Paterra has become
increasingly renowned as the mastermind behind Majeure. Following the
assured debut epic, Timespan, his second album, Solar Maximum,
delivered on the promise of a retro-futurist ambient synth-rock
masterpiece. Romance Language continues this journey with two sprawling,
side-long tracks that marry the sci-fi disco of Timespan with the
celestial Mars-scapes of Solar Maximum. It is both a nod to Majeure's
prior accomplishments, and a peek into his sunspot-bright future –
fitting for an artist whose entire career has been devoted to fluidly
melding the past and the future to create a transcendent present. This
vinyl-only release is strictly limited to 1,000 copies, and includes a
free MP3 download coupon.

"Slippery Slope"
<http://t.ymlp261.net/mqmualauuqmuaaaweagamjjsw/click.php> 
   
In July of 2012, RVNG Intl. was invited to participate in Bulletin
Boards, a group exhibition at Venus Over Manhattan curated by White
Columns’ gallery director Matthew Higgs. An extension of an ongoing
project which resides in the entrance of White Columns’ downtown New
York gallery, Bulletin Boards featured 24 artists/entities, each given a
new bulletin board as an inspirational starting point. In 1981, David
Van Tieghem produced the experimental music video Ear To The Ground. The
film features Van Tieghem “playing” downtown New York City, a world in
which Van Tieghem established his rhythmic roots as a member of the Love
Of Life Orchestra, a frequent collaborator with Laurie Anderson, and a
player on Steve Reich’s Music For 18 Musicians, Robert Ashley’s Perfect
Lives (Private Parts) / Perfect Lives and David Byrne and Brian Eno’s My
Life in the Bush With Ghosts among other seminal recordings including
his own. In Ear To The Ground, all city surfaces become communications—
or bulletins—under Van Tieghem’s twiddling, thwacking and thumping
thumbs. Partially inspired by this and by our blank but physically
limited canvas space, Van Tieghem agreed to take part in a sequence of
improvised performances and creative editing to become part of our
FRKWYS series. We also invited ten younger musicians to post objects to
the board. A cross section of present day New York artists were
represented by way of Sam Hillmer as Diamond Terrifier (with the aid of
Max Alper), Future Shuttle, Georgia, Roberto Carlos Lange as Helado
Negro, Darren Ho, Eli Keszler, Hiro Kone and Megafortress, alongside the
regionally sympathetic Blanche Blanche Blanche and Maxmillion Dunbar. In
place of business cards, broadsheets, and flyers, the
objects/communications contributed were broken toasters, firecrackers,
2x4s, thunder drums and customized electronics, each intended as a
percussive device. On opening night, the bulletin board, disguised as
assemblage, welcomed David’s dialogue. In the spirit of Ear To The
Ground’s infinite conversation, Van Tieghem returned to Venus Over
Manhattan to “play” the bulletin board without an audience. The process
of Van Tieghem discovering and responding to the objects/bulletins again
was multitracked in high definition. These recordings were then
presented to the ten contributing musicians for further translation,
“remix” and interpretation. For the final sequence, the unique pieces
were delivered to Van Tieghem to edit and embellish as the sound
collages presented as Fits & Starts across two album length sides of our
tenth volume in the FRKWYS series.

Saâda Bonaire, the fantastic German disco/world music project from
Bremen which never was meant to be. Formed by Bremen DJ Ralf Behrendt in
1982, Saâda Bonaire was a unique concept band centered around two sultry
female vocalists (Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld) and dozens of
local musicians culled from the local immigration center. Originally
signed to EMI in 1982, their first and only single, “You Could Be More
As You Are” was produced by legendary Matumbi, Slits and Pop Group
producer Dennis Bovell in Kraftwerk's studio in Cologne. Its fusion of
husky female vocals, Eastern instruments, dub and African music
aesthetics, drum computers and synthesizers remains unique to this day.
EMI cancelled the project upon its release.

Saâda Bonaire compiles two songs from the original EMI single plus
eleven previously unreleased songs recorded between 1982 and 1985. Also
included are never before published photos and in depth interviews with
band members and a full gate fold cover for those dedicated vinyl
buyers.

Saâda Bonaire. A bizarre mix of Kraftwerk, Grace Jones, and Marlene
Dietrich. These lost recordings from the early eighties still sound
fresh on today's dance floor.

self-titled debut album on Hometapes this fall. The album features
contributions from members of Yeasayer, Sinkane, and LCD Soundsystem, as
well as Sharon Van Etten. The Brooklyn-based live band inhabits the
warped echoes of ABC, Scritti Politti, The Associates, Happy Mondays,
Japan, A Certain Ratio, Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam, Throbbing Gristle,
