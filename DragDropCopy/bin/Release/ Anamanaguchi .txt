because we're not sure if these links count).

This is really really huge for us. We're up against Toro Y Moi, Bat For
Lashes and Thom Yorke & Flea's new band Atoms For Peace. So far we're
wayyy ahead of all of them in views and shares. There's another dude
DeStorm though, and he's catching up really fast. We really need all the
help we can get to break over.

OTHER NEWSSSSS
I got a call from Red Eye Distribution last Monday saying that the vinyl
was FINALLY in stock and ready for assembly & shipping! I haven't heard
from anyone getting it yet, so let me know when you do! Shirts, USB
drives, everything should be ready for shipping now. Thank you SO much
for your patience in this insane process!

ALSO WE'RE GOING ON TOUR

Finally heading to Ohio! Pittsburgh! And doing a few massive shows with
DILLON FRANCIS. It's going to be insane :)

We'll be playing some new tracks at these shows so we hope to see you
there :)
